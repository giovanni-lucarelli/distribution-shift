\chapter{Giamboost}

The usual approach to mitigate covariate shift conseqences is to quantify the degree of distribution shift and then apply a correction to the model.

In this chapter we propose a robust training method which, in a preliminary analysis, seams to outperform the other models in terms of robustness to covariate shift.

We firstly evaluated this method on the same classification task as the other models, but, since we needed a better way to theoretically understand the inner processes of the training, we decided to apply it to a simple 1-dimensional regression problem.
