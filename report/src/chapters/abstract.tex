\chapter*{Problem Statement}

\label{sec:problem_statement}
This project focuses on evaluating the effects of simple covariate shifts in the input distribution on the performance of various robust models in the context of a synthetic binary classification task. Specifically, it investigates the extent of performance degradation caused by different types of covariate shifts and explores potential strategies to mitigate these challenges.

Key questions addressed in this study include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How do different types of covariate shifts affect the performance of robust models?
    \item Are certain models inherently more robust to simple covariate shifts?
    \item What strategies can be employed to improve model performance following such shifts?
\end{itemize}
