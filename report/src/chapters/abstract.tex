\label{sec:purpose_of_the_study}
This project aims to evaluate the impact of simple covariate shifts in the input distribution on the performance of robust models within the context of a synthetic binary classification task. Specifically, we investigate the degree of performance degradation induced by various types of covariate shifts and explore potential strategies to mitigate these effects.

Key questions addressed in this study include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How do different types of covariate shifts affect the performance of robust models?
    \item Are certain models inherently more robust to simple covariate shifts?
    \item What strategies can be employed to improve model performance following such shifts?
\end{itemize}
