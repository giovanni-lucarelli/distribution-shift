  \begin{itemize}
    \item Distribution shift is a common problem in machine learning.
    \item It occurs when the distribution of the training data differs from the distribution of the test data.
    \item This can lead to a decrease in the performance of the model.
    \item In this study, we analyze the effects of distribution shift on statistical models and propose strategies for its mitigation.
