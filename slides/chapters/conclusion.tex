    \begin{itemize}
        \item Covariate shift was explored via synthetic data and repeated simulations.
        \item Performance degradation highlights the need for "fine-tuned" robust models.
        \item Augmentation showed mitigation potential.
        \item Future work: What to do with R.A.W. .... any suggestion?
