    \begin{itemize}
        \item Covariate shift was explored via synthetic data and repeated simulations.
        \item Performance degradation highlights the need for "fine-tuned" robust models.
        \item Every tuned model performed equally across each shift, with the exception of the Logistic Regression.
        \item \textbf{Future work}: Since augmentation showed mitigation potential, we are think about how to further improve the R.A.W. algorithm.
    \end{itemize}
