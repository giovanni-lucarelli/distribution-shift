\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Covariate Shift} is a common problem where the training and test data distributions differ.
        \item \textbf{Existing Methods} for addressing covariate shift require prior knowledge of the shift or are computationally expensive.
        \item \textbf{R.A.W.} is a novel pre-processing method that addresses covariate shift without prior knowledge of the shift.
        \item \textbf{Gradient Boosting} models trained with R.A.W. outperform models trained with existing methods on shifted test sets.
    \end{itemize}
